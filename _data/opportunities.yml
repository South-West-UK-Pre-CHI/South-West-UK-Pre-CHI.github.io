  summary: We are looking for candidates with strong background in fabrication, design and hardware development to work in the area of cross-sensory shape-changing interfaces and child-computer interaction; in this PhD project you will work as part of the interdisciplinary ERC project inclusiveXplay with a team of PhDs and PDRAs to design and engineer shape-changing interfaces and study their impact on early development of disabled and non-disabled children. You will employ iterative hardware design and development to construct and evaluate a range of prototypes. This will contribute new knowledge to the growing body of literature on cross-sensory interaction, multisensory experience, shape-change and particularly how these are applied in the areas of disability, inclusion, accessibility and child-computer interaction.
